# 02 — merge duplicate `/**:` blocks in `controllers.yaml`

## Problem

`franka_fr3_arm_controllers/config/controllers.yaml` declares `/**:` twice. YAML keeps
the last duplicate key, so the first block — which holds every controller's `type` —
is discarded before ROS sees it.

Symptom:

```
[ERROR] [controller_manager]: The 'type' param was not defined for 'joint_impedance_controller'.
```

## Check

```bash
python3 -c "import yaml; d=yaml.safe_load(open('controllers.yaml')); print(list(d['/**'].keys()))"
```

Broken file prints `['joint_impedance_controller']`. Fixed file prints
`['controller_manager', 'joint_impedance_controller']`.

## Replacement

`arm_id` is added at the same time so it is bound during `on_configure` rather than
having to be set by hand afterwards.

```yaml
/**:
  controller_manager:
    ros__parameters:
      update_rate: 1000  # Hz

      joint_impedance_controller:
        type: franka_fr3_arm_controllers/JointImpedanceController

      joint_state_broadcaster:
        type: joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster

      franka_robot_state_broadcaster:
        type: franka_robot_state_broadcaster/FrankaRobotStateBroadcaster

  joint_impedance_controller:
    ros__parameters:
      arm_id: fr3
      k_alpha: 0.99
      k_gains:
        - 240.0
        - 240.0
        - 240.0
        - 240.0
        - 100.0
        - 60.0
        - 20.0
      d_gains:
        - 20.0
        - 20.0
        - 20.0
        - 10.0
        - 10.0
        - 10.0
        - 5.0
```

Gain values are unchanged from upstream.
